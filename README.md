This document presents the Final Degree Work project of the Video Games Design and
Development Degree by Lucía González García.
The primary aim of this project is to enhance the creation and personalization of
digital avatars using Deep Learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN) technology. The objective is to enable users to generate avatars based on
their own photographs, such as selfies, and apply various desired image styles. To achieve
this, an application has been developed, allowing users to upload their images and apply
predefined styles such as manga, cartoons, and more. The outcome will be a harmonious
combination of the original image and the selected style, resulting in a coherent visual
output.
